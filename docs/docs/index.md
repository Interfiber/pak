# Pak
Pak allows you to build MacOS installer files with ease

## Why?
Since apple removed Package Maker from Xcode, its been hard to make pkg installer files. The only preinstalled tools to build them are
```pkgbuild```, and ```productbuild```. Since these tools have little documentation on apples website, it can be hard to use them if you just want to quickly build a package installer for you're software. This is why pak exists, to simplify the installer building process.
